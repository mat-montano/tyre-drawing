# tyre-drawing
This sketch was created to automate the process of drawing repeated components, in this case tyres. The user types in the desired measureaments split by a dash. After, clicks "generare" to generate the drawing. After that, the user has to click neatly (1-rubber, 2-external ring, 3-both flanges, 4-hub) into the faces to apply the hatch.

<b>Installation of FreeCAD v.18 is a pre-requirement<b>
